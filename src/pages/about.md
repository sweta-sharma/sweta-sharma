This personal blog is my way of organizing my brain and tagging my opinions. I am a software engineer and pursue a lot of hobbies. I enjoy improving my skills and learn new ones. I read a lot and love thought experiments.

The posts in this space are my opinions and I might not always be able to add citations for all the threads. This is my attempt to pen down how ideas link in my brain and it's very likely that someone else reading them might not agree with the connections. Even I might disagree with them at a later point in time.

Cheers!
